## Magic ball

This is an old "eight ball" toy application, where the user ask a question and press the "Ask Me!" button to get the answer.
As a huge Disney lover that I am, in this version I made a reference to one of my favorite Disney parks' ride: Phantom Manor (or Haunted Mansion, depending on which park You are thinking of).

The launch screen is a reference to the story transcripts and old mansion wallpaper. The answers are a mention to some of Madame Leota's quotes other than the regular "8-ball" kind of answer.

Below You'll see the LaunchScreen followed by some answers examples:<br/>
